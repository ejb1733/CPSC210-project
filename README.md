 <p>This project is intended for UBC Science students to use when figuring out their
 course worklists - which can prove to be quite the feat! This project is of interest to me,
 as I believe that UBC's Course Navigator could benefit from a list of what pre-requisites a course fulfills.
 For example, CPSC 110 is a direct pre-requisite for CPSC 210! That way, students can better choose between
 two classes (say, MATH 210 and CPSC 210... where CPSC 210 is a pre-requisite for many classes,
 while MATH 210 is not.

This project is based off the courses listed at https://www.cs.ubc.ca/prerequisite-rules </p>
