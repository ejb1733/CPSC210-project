<h3 style="text-align:center"> <em>a Course Navigator for UBC Science Students</em></h3>

<center>Below are some features of the Course Navigator:</center>

- save your course schedule and check for missing pre-requisites
- visualize a course's requirements
- visualize the ***children*** of a pre-requisite course

> as I believe that UBC's Course Navigator could benefit from a list of what pre-requisites a course fulfills.
> For example, CPSC 110 is a direct pre-requisite for CPSC 210! That way, students can better choose between
