<h3 style="text-align:center"> <em>UBC WonderfulWorklists</em></h3>

<center>Below are some features of the program:</center>

- create, and name, your very own worklists!
- create your own courses
- add first to fourth year UBC CPSC courses to your worklist
- view your worklists and all their courses
- modify your worklists' by changing their names, adding/removing courses
- delete worklists
- save / load your worklists from a file
 
 <p>This project is intended for UBC Science students to use when figuring out their
 course worklists - which can prove to be quite the feat! This project is of interest to me,
 as I believe that UBC's Course Navigator could benefit from a list of what pre-requisites a course fulfills.
 For example, CPSC 110 is a direct pre-requisite for CPSC 210. That way, students can better choose between
 two classes (say, MATH 210 and CPSC 210... where CPSC 210 is a pre-requisite for many classes,
 while MATH 210 is not.

This project is based off the courses listed at https://www.cs.ubc.ca/prerequisite-rules </p>

- more efficiently create the default courses, such as by using an enum
- access the WorklistList without having to extend Courses
- remove redundant associations (already done)
